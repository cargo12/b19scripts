Various examples of Python or BASH scripting funness.
Some are extremely functional and maybe even slightly original, whereas others are simply meant to be instructional. This is where all my scripts start, but the best ones end up in their own repo,
like [xsos](https://github.com/ryran/xsos) or [Pyrite](https://github.com/ryran/pyrite).
