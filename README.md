Various examples of Python or BASH scripting funness.
Some are extremely functional and maybe even slightly original, whereas others
are simply meant to be instructional (I used to teach Red Hat classes). This is
where all my scripts start, but the best ones end up in their own repo,
like [hhwchk](/ryran/hhwchk), [tail2notify](/ryran/tail2notify), or [Pyrite](/ryran/pyrite).
